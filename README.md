## Introduction

vEditor is a simple/powerful text editing software developed by 12-year-old [Vihaan Mody](http://bit.ly/vmody1). It was created by using [Python](https://www.python.org/) and the library [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter). vEditor is a simple editor for creative purposes providing colorful themes and easy elements to understand. You can download the latest version once Version 1.0 is released.

## Basic Usage
